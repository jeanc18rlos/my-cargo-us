(W x L x H) / 166. \nThe largest size of your box will always be charged, if it is heavier it will be shipped by weight; if it is more volumetric it will be shipped by volume. \nOcean Freight: All cargo shipped by sea is charged in relation to the volume of your cargo, it is calculated based on the measures in inches (2.54 cms) of the shipment regardless of the weight, that is to say by its volume. The formula to get the cubic feet of your cargo is height x width x depth, that result must be divided by 1728, the result is the cubic feet of your box, the formula to apply is: (Length x Width x Height) / 1728. \nThis tells us that your volume is based on the cubic foot, which must be multiplied by our shipping rate according to the desired destination. \nGround Freight: It is charged in relation to the volume weight, it is calculated for each pound (0.45Kg) of weight that the shipment has, and also the measures of the box are verified to obtain the volume weight. For land cargo the following formula is applied: Multiply the three measurements of your box in inches and then divide by 139.
